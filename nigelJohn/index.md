I was shocked and terribly saddened to hear that we lost **Nigel John** on Saturday afternoon.
The awful news was communicated by colleagues at the University of Bangor.

I knew Nigel as a committed, competent, encouraging and inspiring cyclist and would like to share some of his exploits.
He regularly rode with the [CTC (Cyclists' Touring Club)](https://www.cyclinguk.org/) and actively sought out unexplored parts of the World, usually on his titanium Lynskey bike, which he would regularly prop up and photograph mid-ride.

Nigel shared much of _the former_, the riding, on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2710835/) where had recorded more than 4,000km of cycling this year. His [2017 Infographic](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2710835/posts/1057442) showed that he had ridden on 229 days and covered 4,300 miles in 318 hours on the bike. This involved the equivalent of 5 ascents of Mount Everest. His [2022 highlights](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2710835/posts/23031166) showed that he was on the road on 276 of the days in the year - one of the top 2% most active on Strava. In total, [Nigel’s Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2710835) shows **57,000km** of riding, involving **350km** of climbing (vertical ascent) and more than **2,700** hours in the saddle since 2013. This involves around four and a half hours of riding per week on average - mostly outdoors, but some on his trainer indoors.

He undertook _the latter_, the exploration, systematically, logging the ‘_squadrats_’ - squares of 1 mile by 1 mile - that he visited across the country. [Nigel visited **3,348 squadrats**](https://squadrats.com/map/awbf6rDqhgeIeNGBatbCJkk9TEz2), with an impressive ‘_yard_’ or footprint of **1,592** interconnected 1 mile squares. His _Übersquadrat_ - his largest square completely filled with visited smaller squares - is **32x32**, an area including that includes Ellesmere Port, Knutsford, Crewe, Market Drayton, Oswestry, Wrexham and Chirk.

He completed this with [a ride in Staffordshire this August](https://www.strava.com/activities/9666488445), and it puts him at **#575** in the standings at [squadrats.com](https://squadrats.com/standings).

Having followed Nigel’s exploits, and shared cycling experiences over the years - we both love the Severn Bridge run, we always give and share kudos after a ride - I suspect that Nigel might want to be remembered by the geographic footprint that he made with his bike.<br/>It's amazing.

I’ll miss him, and watching him develop this.<br/>
But, what an achievement.

**Jason**.
