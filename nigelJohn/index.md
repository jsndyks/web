### Nigel John - Cyclist

I was shocked and terribly saddened to hear that we lost **Nigel John** on Saturday afternoon.
The awful news was communicated by colleagues at the University of Bangor.

I knew Nigel as a committed and competent cyclist and would like to share some of his exploits.
He regularly rode with the CTC (Cyclists' Touring Club) and actively sought out unexplored parts of the World, usually on his titanium Lynskey bike.

Nigel shared much of the former on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2710835/) where had recorded more than 4,000km of rides this year. His [2017 Infographic](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2710835/posts/1057442) showed that he had ridden on 229 days and covered 4,300 miles in 318 hours of cycling. This involved the equivalent of 5 ascents of Mount Everest. His [2022 highlights](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2710835/posts/23031166) showed that he was on his bike for 276 of the days in the year - one of the top 2% most active on Strava. In total, [Nigel’s Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2710835) shows **57,000km** of riding, involving **350km** of climbing (vertical ascent) and more than **2,700** hours in the saddle on his bike since 2013 - about four and a half hours per week on average.

He did the latter, the exploration, systematically, logging the ‘_squadrats_’ - squares of 1 mile by 1 mile - that he visited across the country. Nigel visited **3,348 squadrats**, with an impressive ‘_yard_’ of **1,592** interconnected 1 mile squares. His _Übersquadrat_ - his largest square completely filled with visited squadrats - is **32x32**, covering an area including Ellesmere Port, Knutsford, Crewe, Market Drayton, Oswestry, Wrexham and Chirk.

He completed this with a ride in Staffordshire this August, and it puts him at **#575** in that standings at [squadrats.com](https://squadrats.com/standings).

Having followed Nigel’s rides, and shared cycling experiences over the years - we both love the Severn Bridge run - I suspect that Nigel might want to be remembered by the geographic footprint that he made with his bike. It's amazing.

I’ll miss him, and watching him develop this.
But, what an achievement.

Jason.
