I'm working with some friends on a paper in which we think about the value of _reflective practice_ in our learning, teaching and research:

 * **The Value(s) of Visualization:<br/>Reflections on Reflective Practice in Visualization Research, Teaching, and Learning**

One of the things we have decided to do here is to:

> _individually discuss our positionality and report personal reflections and reactions from our work together to highlight the diversity of our experiences._

<!-- 
> individually discuss the positions that we occupy and report personal reflections and reactions from our work together to highlight the diversity of our perspectives and experiences.
 -->

Now, I haven't read enough about positionality statements, I need to do more here.
But I do see both their merit in acknowledging experiences and values that influence research and its focus, approaches and outcomes (_Singh et al., 2025_) 
and consider such statements to be have great potential for promoting and prompting reflexivity and self-awareness in both the producers and consumers of research (_Ashcroft et al., 2025_).

However, disclosure of identity through themed labels (_Singh et al. (2025)_ find the academic background, gender, ethnicity, nationality and race are most frequently disclosed in positionality and reflexivity statements in the CHI papers over the last 11 years) can lead to assumptions that emphasize normative assumptions (_Singh et al., 2025_).
And while I am privileged enough to be in a position where disclosure is unlikely to lead to my persecution, I can see the dangers and risks associated with disclosure and detail too.

So, what to do?<br/>
Well, the more I thought about it, the more I realised that some of the values, priorities and approaches that influence me, that affect my interests, choices and interpretations, are long term.
They are the result of my ongoing development, my trajectory of life.
And I don't mind sharing them.

So I have jotted down a few of the experiences and characteristics that feel, on reflection, as though they influence my efforts, my approach and that capture my motivations and biases: _this is me_.

They affect this work, but also much of the other work I have done and will do.
I decided that I could make reference to a single external grounding position statement to anchor more specific reflexive pieces in any particular papers that I write. And I can update this document as my position changes.<br/>
I have no clear notion as to whether this is a good idea or not, but I thought it worth a try. And, I have found selecting and exposing these influential experiences pretty useful - thought provoking, for me at any rate.

I have deliberately avoided listing people: another thorny issue - who to credit and who to castigate?<br/>
But I am indebted to many generous and intelligent colleagues who have inspired, empowered, aided, encouraged and on occasion stopped me ... for getting me to where I am (and not where I amn't).<br/>
And of course I take all the blame.

### POSITIONALITY &amp; INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES

I’m a cisgender straight white man from a stable middle-class family in a quiet culturally and ethnically homogenous corner of South-West England. I had a comprehensive education (state school, mixed ability classes) in the 1980s where we were encouraged to create and be expressive rather than comply. I was parented by two science teachers, whose education gave them opportunities beyond those afforded by their modest backgrounds, and the BBC. Despite the biology and physics by day, Mum and Dad were both active in the arts in the evenings - through amateur musicals, choirs and by coordinating the local Arts Festival - and irrepressibly outdoorsy.
Family holidays involved long days in the open air with maps and picnics and lots of scrambling and exploring. Weekends were spent in the veg garden and on bicycles. I did quite a lot of computer programming at night in my teens. My machine, developed and distributed as part of the BBC's Computer Literacy Project, was very noisy but intoxicatingly empowering.

My 40 years learning and teaching in three UK Universities
have involved developing interactive visual approaches for data exploration, working towards legitimate new processes of knowledge production and in doing so, questioning the dominating limiting epistemic norms in CS.

I started at _Oxford_, where I felt lost and daunted, but benefitted from an incoherent geography degree that was conducively eclectic in terms of epistemology, focus and approach. We learned about the world, but also about learning about the world, with remnants of the quantitative revolution and systems thinking in the morning, literature study to explore perspectives on slavery and emancipation in the afternoon and then (in a highly appropriate masterstroke, but never in a manner that seemed to be in any way planned or deliberate) David Harvey focusing on social justice through a Marxian dialectic. It was a _geographyology_ degree really, the continual focus on how and what and whether we might know was its strength. I played lots of football.

At _Leicester_ I spent a year learning how to use computers to do geography on a wonderfully enabling GIS program funded by government on recommendation of the _Chorley Report_. Eight years of part-time PhD followed while I worked on educational projects that blended diverse data with innovative interactive graphical software to support constructivist learning with technology, much of this in the field.

During this time a diaspora of “_quantitative geographers_” left geography as the validity of approaches that involved numbers was rejected by many under the accusation of determinism: false, naive, in my view and experience as the enumerators were often reassuringly thoughtful in their work and responsible in their claims and speculation. I had always felt that dismissing any use of numbers to inform because they were all biased and imperfect was as unwise as rejecting any general model because it was always too abstract to explain detail or any specific model or description because it was always too narrow to offer useful scope. Surely diverse perspectives on the world, with detailed thinking about their value, provenance, strengths and limitations, help us understand it, particularly if we have, or can establish, ways to relate them?

Anyhow, along with many other computing geographers, I ended up in Computer Science, via Information Science: at _The City University_ -> _City University_ -> _City University, London_ -> _City, University of London_ -> _City St George’s, University of London_  ... an institution that while nominally capricious has a steady profile involving high proportions of students: from areas with high levels of deprivation;
from a Black, Asian and minority ethnic background;
and, who, just like my parents, are ‘first in family’ to go on to higher education.
City is recognized nationally for social mobility.<br/>
I have taught at all levels (_foundation_ to _PhD_), for various Departments (_CS_, _Engineering_, _Educational Development_, _Information Science_, _Sociology &amp; Criminology_) in classes ranging in size from less than 4 to more than 400 (_Can you hear me at the back?_).<br/>
I have helped establish and develop a group that has been innovative in data visualization education and research. Much of this innovation has involved leveraging the geographic and cartographic perspective to do interesting new data-driven Computer Science. It has involved working in many application areas with a diverse collection of colleagues: the [dplb CS Bibliography](https://dblp.org/pid/34/5069.html) lists 82 research papers with 194 different co-authors.
We are playing a major role in shaping and delivering a new PhD training program that is of national significance - the EPSRC Centre for [Doctoral Training in Diversity in Data Visualization (DIVERSE-CDT)](https://diverse-cdt.ac.uk).

I am able bodied but aging and having a bit of an adventure with cancer in my late 50s.<br/>
I have four kids with my partner of 30 years: two are at University, two at secondary school.<br/>
Their complex developing dynamic identities: male, female, dizygotic twin, bi, straight, trans, cis, undecided, and neurodivergent, have taught me plenty. <br/>
I have caring commitments up (aging &amp; dementia) as well as down.

I have no evidence that I am not neurotypical.<br/>
English, the _lingua franca_ of science, is my first language.<br/>
I have never worked outside of education.

I recognize and am grateful for the privileges and social advantages from which I have benefitted. They have given me the knowledge, skills and resources to make &amp; explore, travel &amp; communicate, and the stability upon much of which this is based.
I strive to see and account for these in my thinking, to use them to investigate the processes of knowledge production.

The details provided here are an attempt to position me as a researcher and capture aspects of identity that may be relevant to my teaching and research: the topics selected, approaches taken, methods employed, claims made and ways in which all of this is emphasized and communicated.  

I am sure there are many others: manifest &amp; latent.
