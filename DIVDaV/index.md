1. **Focus:** _We study visualization in diverse forms in diverse contexts in diverse ways_

   - We are committed to developing understanding of the use, effects and potential of graphics in diverse contexts;
   - We consider visualization as a means for revelation, reflection and reporting throughout analytical workflows;
   - We bring data to life, embracing, embodying and exhibiting data humanism;
   - We are not constrained by organisational or disciplinary structures, arbitrary labels, geographic boundaries or particular domain foci, and strive to work across these.

2. **Objective:** _We develop a supportive environment to undertake high quality research_

   - Our intention is to promote research and support each other to:
     - find the time for research
     - plan for research
     - undertake research
     - consider, discuss & inspire research
     - establish and acquire connections and funding to support &amp; sustain research
     - develop a critical, supportive, energetic and motivating research culture;
   - We value quality, originality and creativity over quantity;
   - We aim to surprise, inform, expose, inspire, disrupt and help.

3. **Approach:** _We are critical, responsible, open, realistic and kind_

   - We are critical, generous and supportive;
   - We are responsible, responsive and aim to do good;
   - We are open in our practices and communications;
   - We reflect fully, invite scrutiny and are realistic about claims and reliability;
   - We are diverse in outlook and generous in acknowledgment of credit for the research that we do;
   - We care for those we work for and with, and recognise the tensions, responsibilities and actions that being careful and caring require.

4. **Resources:** _We support each other by sharing funding, knowledge and resources_

   - We share funding voluntarily.<br/>Finances acquired through funded projects that Project project consider to be Project projects are shared: 80% Project, 20% to individual investigators - some private funds are efficient for small uncontroversial items.

5. **Activity:** _We take collective responsibility for initiatives, quality and profile_

   - Project people all contribute to Web and social media presence in positive ways;
   - Project people take initiative, with invitations, communications, provocations and by organising interesting activities;
   - Project people are generous with their time and provide constructive critique.

6. **Governance:** _We decide collectively, we communicate frequently and openly_

   - Decision-making is collective;
   - Leadership is collective, our leaders lead by example;
   - Meetings are open and regular;
   - Project lead(s) change(s) regularly, every 3 years max;
   - Project people figure out rules for spending allocation and approval collectively.

7. **Reporting:** _We do not report, we are not burdened by a reporting structure_

   - We do no report explicitly - we write papers, bid for grants, go to conferences, chat and tweet stuff, discuss and reflect;
   - We operate within University rules and regulations, but outside of any formal University management structure.

8. **Lifespan:** _We decide who we are, how we operate and when to stop_

   - We decide whether to continue for another year every September;
   - We update our living manifesto regularly and collectively.

9. **Participation:** _We are welcoming and use and develop this manifesto to ...<br/>be productive, do good, be human and have fun,<br/>as we learn and inform in ways that are collectively and individually fulfilling for all involved_

   - We have no membership criteria;
   - We have no exclusion criteria;
   - Project people simply pledge allegiance üôÇ to this living manifesto and contribute by shaping the project, its culutre, activity and manfesto;
   - Project people are encouraged to join and participate in more than one research constellation;
   - We are open and welcoming.
