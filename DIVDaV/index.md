1. **Focus:** _We study visualization in diverse forms in diverse contexts in diverse ways_

   - We are committed to developing understanding of the use, effects and potential of graphics in diverse contexts.
   - We consider visualization as a means for revelation, reflection and reporting throughout analytical workflows
   - We bring data to life, embracing, embodying and exhibiting data humanism
   - We are not constrained by organisational or disciplinary structures, arbitrary labels, geographic boundaries or particular domain foci, and strive to work across these.

2. **Objective:** _We develop a supportive environment to undertake high quality research_

3. **Approach:** _We are critical, responsible, open, realistic and kind_

4. **Funding:** _We support each other by sharing funding, knowledge and resources_

5. **Activity:** _We take collective responsibility for initiatives, quality and profile_

6. **Governance:** _We decide collectively, we communicate frequently and openly_

7. **Reporting:** _We do not report, we are not burdened by a reporting structure_

8. **Lifespan:** _We decide who we are, how we operate and when to stop_

9. **Participation:** _We do our best to use and develop this manifesto to be productive, do good, be human and have fun<br/>as we learn and inform in ways that are collectively and individually fulfilling_
