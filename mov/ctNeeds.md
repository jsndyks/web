### DiVERSE-CDT Logo - NEEDS

<style>
    img {margin:4px; padding:2px; border:1px dashed #e0e0e0}
    p {padding-top:0.5em; padding-bottom:0.5em}
    h1 a {display:none}
    .footer {color:rgba(0,0,0,0) !important; font-size:0px}
    .footer a {color:rgba(0,0,0,0) !important; font-size:0px}
    .footer #text {display:none !important; font-size:0px}
    .footer a {display:none !important; font-size:0px}
</style>

#### CONCEPT 1

What we think we want from Wednesday in Leicester to converge and make progress on _Concept 1_ are :

##### **Agreed Text & Fonts**

DIVERSECDT text, 5x1 (characters are 1x2) with type family (font), type face (weights, instances) that make DIVERSE and CDT separable in  black & white.

Ideally we would use a font that we can access and use for other purposes too.

Hopefully we can find a typeface that is scalable, has a family of multiple weights and is free.

BebasNeue is great in many ways but seems not to have a series of styled typefaces with different weights (bold, book, medium, light, etc.)

##### **Usable instances**

A few __instances__ of the 60 tile idea that __we can use right away__.
In at least two aspect ratios - 10x10 (square) and 10x1 (header) 
In at least a couple of colour schemes - palettes that are not based upon City or Warwick brands.

We would rather not give you data for these, but have you use your design skill to make logo instances that just look good - whatever criteria suit you!<br/>Make them bold, beautiful and interesting!

**We’d like you to make good looking logos within whatever constraints that are not data dependent - we can then use these beautiful examples to inspire our subsequent data vis design.**

##### **Logos in Context**

We need to know what the logo would look like in use as a visual identity for the CDT.

Version for WebSite … that perhaps fits into 10x2.

How would this look as a Web page that give us visual identity, with the color schemes and styling that you propose using.

We’d like you to show us how we use this design in web pages, brochures, presentations, etc.

##### **Work Towards Constraints**

We will need the constraints that you use in developing the instances
E.g. (and these are just ideas, we will leave CT to advise)
 - Nothing within each square / tile goes beyond the square.
 - Nothing interferes with characters or the spaces between text and data.
 - Text is always black, or always a single colour (maybe? maybe not?)
 - Do we require grid spacing? Or not?
 - etc.

#### CONCEPT 2

Less clear!
We didn’t discuss this at DIVERSE-CDT, but ...

 - Usable instances
 - Logos in Context
