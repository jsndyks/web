### Supervisors

Both PhD supervisors will **not** be persistent throughout the entire PhD process - this is in line with our _diversity_ &amp; _cohort collaboration_ objectives.

The model is supported by the resources and structures that are in place that would have conventionally fallen on a typical supervisor – _Research Scientist_, _Cohort Training_, _shared open notebooks_, _shared space_, _action learning sets_, _retreats &amp; training_, etc. 

Allocation of supervisors will be at end of each year: _September_.

Supervision during the taught part of the programme (Y1 FT) is _personal tutor_ style:

Supervision during the research part of the programme (Y2-Y4 FT) involves :

 - **first supervisor** - one persistent / continuity / permanent supervisor<br/> a _DataVis_ researcher<br/>_retained for the entire programme_

 - **second supervisor** - one annual / specialist / temporary supervisor - thematic / domain supervisor (_may be an academic mentor who provides an academic internship_)<br/> one year role, may return in Y4.

 Lists of supervisors is agreed each year: _September_

 All combinations at City must involve at least one CAT A supervisor in lime with local rules &amp; regs.

#### Year 1

 * Y1 Supervisors allocated
     - first from DIVERSE-CDT Management Committee<br/>
    (_and DataVis pool_?)  
     - second nominal – either _Research Scientist_ or, if Cat A required, _CDT Director_

 * Y2+ Supervisors 'emerge' through structures process

#### Year 2-3 (Engagements)

 * one visualization supervisor
 * one thematic / domain supervisor

#### Year 4 (Synthesis)

*  second supervisor in synthesis year should normally supervised the student previously

### Questions

   * What is the link between co-supervision and academic placement providers? _Soft_?
   * How do supervisors ensure that internships are focused on research development, outcomes, leading if these go off course/become more production focused?<br/>
   _We need to introduce internship providers to out expectations and the workings and benefits of a visualization internship / placement / engagement_
   * How does supervisor matchmaking work: _pitches?_
   * How do we make academic internships and 1-year co-supervision attractive to academic colleagues?
   * How do we describe an academic internship?

### Incentives

_How do we make supervision attractive to and count for people in terms of recognition and interest?_

 * **CoSupervisor** – here’s what it is, here’s what’s in it for you, do you want to do it?
 * **Mentor** – here’s what it is, here’s what’s in it for you, do you want to do it?

> Need to disentangle these!

_Academic Internship Providers :_

Benefits ...

 * model of engagement introduced and discussed
 * research outputs : _tech solution_, _proposal_, _poster_, _paper_, 
 * knowledge of vis possibilities
 * capacity
 * participation in DIVERSE-CDT activities &amp; network
 * something for promotion: credit, completions, outputs, skills, knowledge, collaboration<br/>_Need to negotiate with Doctoral College_

 Costs &amp; Expectations ...

 * engagement costs - understanding expectations, supervision, training &amp; away days
  - 1 afternoon CDT orientation
  - 1 workshop per year (on something)
