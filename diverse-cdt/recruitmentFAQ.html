            <p><strong>The next application deadline will be 28th March, 4pm GMT.<br>The application portal is available at <a href="index.html">DIVERSE-CDT.ac.uk</a> from mid-February.</strong></p>
            <p>We are recruiting 12 students to take part in fully funded PhD research training in data visualization at The University of Warwick, and City St George&#x2019;s, University of London. Successful applicants in this round will begin their studies in October 2025. Enquiries from those with a love of data and a desire to use it well are encouraged.</p>
            <p>We welcome applications from all, and especially from people whose perspectives and experiences are currently under-represented in data visualization. This includes those who identify as one or more of the following: those who are female, those from Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, and those from low-income backgrounds or areas experiencing high levels of deprivation. We are conscious that there are different ways of describing such under-representation, and that no description will work for every individual: the wording we use here is intended to invite and include.</p>
            <p><strong>This is a dynamic WebSite and a live FAQ: we are logging Frequently Asked Questions as we receive them and adding answers based on questions we receive.

            <h2 class="mume-header" id="what-is-data-visualization">What is Data Visualization?</h2>
            
            <p>Visualization involves creating graphics that show complex phenomena in ways that help people understand them. This is critical to problem solving in the 21st century: connecting digital data with human cognition in powerful ways.</p>
            <p>Evolving technology and approaches in science mean that data visualization has great potential for wide impact in terms of understanding environment and society, and communicating some of the complexities of challenging phenomena in interpretable forms.</p>
            <p>You can find a wide range of examples of Data Visualization on the <a href="https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?">Information is Beautiful Awards</a> webpages.</p>
            <h2 class="mume-header" id="what-is-the-diverse-cdt">What is the DIVERSE CDT?</h2>
            
            <p>DIVERSE CDT is:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>an EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Diversity in Data Visualization.</li>
            <li>a collaboration between City St George&apos;s and the University of Warwick, funded by the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/">Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</a> (EPSRC).</li>
            <li>an interdisciplinary team of world-leading researchers with expertise spanning data visualization, human-computer interaction design, social justice and equity, and innovation creativity and leadership.</li>
            <li>offering up to 12 fully funded PhD studentships (a four-year course) each year for the next five years to train new leaders in data visualization.</li>
            <li>innovative, backed by a range of partners, and run by institutions that have proven capability and research quality.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="mume-header" id="where-might-i-fit-into-this">Where might I fit into this?</h2>
            
            <p>Whether or not you &#x2018;fit&#x2019; existing expectations of who a data visualization expert is - including your own - you can bring new knowledge, perspectives, priorities, causes and ideas to the field, to apply and inform data visualization.<br>
            Through the DIVERSE CDT you have the opportunity to work on and advocate for data-related problems and topics important to you.<br>
            Each PhD studentship is four-years (full-time), enabling you to work on a diversity of projects with a range of organisations as you develop a digital thesis.</p>
            <h2 class="mume-header" id="why-does-diversity-in-data-visualization-matter">Why does Diversity in Data Visualization matter?</h2>
            
            <p>Data visualization is stronger if people from diverse backgrounds and disciplines and with a wide range of interests are involved in developing the field.</p>
            <p>Whether or not you &#x2018;fit&#x2019; existing expectations of who a data visualization expert is you can bring new knowledge, perspectives, priorities, causes and ideas to the field, to apply and inform data visualization.</p>
            <p>Science, industry and society need people with advanced data visualization capabilities. The EPSRC has funded DIVERSE CDT to address this skills gap.</p>
            <h2 class="mume-header" id="what-is-a-phd">What is a PhD?</h2>
            
            <ul>
            <li>A PhD, or Doctor of Philosophy, represents one of the highest levels of academic achievement.</li>
            <li>It is a research degree: research involves knowing how to answer challenging questions reliably and understanding the quality of your answers and where they can be applied.</li>
            <li>Typically, PhDs involve working on a single specialist project over the course of 3-4 years. The DIVERSE CDT is a four-year programme for full-time students.</li>
            <li>Earning this distinguished qualification grants you the title of &apos;Doctor&apos; and unlocks opportunities for senior professional positions.</li>
            <li>PhD holders often build impactful careers as researchers, lecturers, or professors, and their expertise is equally valued in industry, government, and non-profit sectors, and associated with advanced roles.</li>
            <li>Specialising in Data Visualization for your PhD sets you apart as a leading expert in this field, significantly enhancing your career prospects and professional recognition in a growing area.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="mume-header" id="what-would-phd-study-with-the-diverse-cdt-involve">What would PhD study with the DIVERSE CDT involve?</h2>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Training in data analysis, visual design, user experience and the technologies.</li>
            <li>Developing research methods that enable understanding and use of data visualization in diverse contexts.</li>
            <li>Participation in 3-6 month internships with academic and industrial partners across public, private and not-for-profit sectors.</li>
            <li>Structured learning, workshops, and mentorship tailored around your needs and interests.</li>
            <li>Being part of a diverse and active cohort &#x2013; working and learning together as you create data visualizations and undertake research.</li>
            <li>Producing an interactive portfolio of research using a digital notebook, which replaces the traditional PhD &apos;thesis&apos; on this programme.</li>
            <li>Attending international conferences and residential retreats to discuss progress and ideas with researchers and project partners.</li>
            <li>Working with a mentor to identify your interests and learning needs, subject experts and a research scientist to support you.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On a full-time basis, and in very broad terms:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p>Year 1: Training in research methods, data visualization techniques and technologies, across diverse social contexts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Years 2 and 3: Industry and academic placements, lab exchange visits, developing linked research projects with bespoke supervision</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Year 4: Refining a critical lens that extends across your individual and collaborative work to date, working towards submission of the digital thesis via digital notebook.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Full-time students are expected to spend an average of 35 hours a week working towards their PhD, and to be available for in-person collaboration and placements during the working week.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>All years will include cohort collaboration and engagement across the DIVERSE CDT, and reflection on your projects and progress via the digital notebook.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="mume-header" id="why-does-the-diverse-cdt-differ-from-other-phd-programmes">Why does the DIVERSE CDT differ from other PhD Programmes?</h2>
            
            <ul>

            <li>You can toggle backwards and forwards through the application form. We would recommend that you draft your answers in a separate document and add them onto the form once you are happy with your answers. We have PDF and Word versions of the form that you can use when drafting.</li>
