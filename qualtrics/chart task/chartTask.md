This visualization test will take you about 20 minutes.

It will help you think about the kinds of things a visualization can and can not do. The results will let us know a little bit about the different tasks that can be achieved with similar visualisations of the same data.

We have made 5 different graphics of a data set, and will give you one of these that we will ask you to use to attempt about 10 tasks. The graphic that you get will be one of 4 or 5 different graphics that we have created of the data. It will be randomly selected.

We think that some of the tasks should be _pretty easy_ - they might take you a few seconds to get a reasonable answer.
Some tasks will be _quite difficult_ - they may require some thinking and a be a bit of a mental challenge, but you will be able to give an answer to the question that you are happy with in under a minute.
Some tasks are likely to be _almost impossible_. If you have spent a minute of so trying to answer and can't come up with an answer in which you have much confidence then that counts as _almost impossible_.

The graphics show deaths around The World from 'clinical pneumonia' in different age groups, and how these have varied over time. Each is based on the same data set produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in 2018, which was then used by Dadonaite & Roser (2020) in their '_Our World in Data_' piece on pneumonia.

So, all you need to do is run the survey, make sure you have the single graphic that you need to use for all the tasks open, and then complete the tasks and give us feedback on the level of challenge.

We will collate the responses and see which graphics work, and which fail, for each of the tasks.
